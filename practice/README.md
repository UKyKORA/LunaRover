# Practice Gitlabs
Welcome to the practice projects for coding on KORA's team!

* Submission scheme for each gitlab is as follows: {firstname}_{lastname}_gitlab{x}.py

* Any questions or problems with the labs can be directed to the software channel on Slack, or one of the software officers of the club (Josh Ashley, Matt Ruffner). 

## Gitlab Purpose

* Some of these practice problems will be fundamental, and neccesary for all coder's to comprehend, and some will be more specific.

  - **Please** ensure that you understand how to do all of the fundamental gitlabs and put the concepts learned into the work you do on the robot. 
  - Many fundamentals will be about how to organize your program in a practical and readable way. These fundamentals are meant to make all of 
  our lives easier and should be practiced as best as possible.
