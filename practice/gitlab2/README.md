# Gitlab 2
This gitlab is meant to start to introduce you to Python and what is called "Pythonic Execution". 

Review what these programs are doing an make sure you understand each command in the execution.

* Execute matrix_test.py to see what it is doing.
* Look through matrix and matrix_test and see if you can understand how it is generating this output. 
* Try and use the matrix library to implement your own program.
