# ROS Intro Gitlab
### KORA Software Team Oct. 7th, 2019

This gitlab it meant to be overviewed during the meeting and comeback to on your own time... There is a decent amount reading to be done to get a decent understanding of what ROS can do. 

These guides are best done in Ubuntu. Although Windows Subsystem for Linux is suitable for writing code, running ROS core and RVis (the visualization software) are best done on an actual ubuntu installation. This can be done easily with The free [Virtual Box Software](https://www.virtualbox.org/), and a download of an [ubuntu image](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop).
